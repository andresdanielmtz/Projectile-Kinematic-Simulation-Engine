# Projectile Kinematic Simulation Engine 
## Computational Modelling for Engineering 

The Final Project of the Computacional Modelling for Engineer Course @ Tec de Monterrey. 
This is the practical and technical approach to the area of modelling computational solutions in a real-life situation.

To run this script you **need to use** MATLAB or any other open-source alternative like [GNU Onclave](https://octave.org/).
To do this just run either `eulerFinal.m` or `real/eulerFinal.m`
